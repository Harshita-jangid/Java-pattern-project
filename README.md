# Java Pattern Printing Project (Menu Driven)

## 📌 Project Overview
This is a **Menu Driven Pattern Printing Application** developed in **Java** as part of my **BCA 2nd Year, Semester 3** coursework at **Dezyne École College, Ajmer**.  
The project demonstrates how different **patterns** (stars, numbers, shapes) can be printed using **loops and modular programming**.

---

## 🎯 Features
- **Interactive Menu** – Select the desired pattern from a console-based menu.
- **Multiple Pattern Options** – Star patterns, numeric patterns, and more.
- **Custom Input** – Enter the size/rows for patterns dynamically.
- **Loop-based Logic** – Uses `for` and `while` loops for generating designs.
- **Exit Anytime** – Option to close the program from the menu.

---

## 🛠️ Technologies Used
- **Language:** Java
- **IDE:** (e.g., IntelliJ IDEA / Eclipse / NetBeans / VS Code)
- **Concepts Applied:** Loops, Nested Loops, Methods, Menu Driven Programming

## 🚀 How to Run the Project
1. **Clone the repository**  
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Harshita-jangid/java-pattern-project.git
   
2. **Open the project in any Java IDE or text editor.**

3. **Compile and run the PatternProject.java file.**

4. **Select a pattern from the menu and view the output in the console.**


📚 Learning Outcomes
 1. Understanding of nested loops in Java.

 2. Modular code design using methods.
